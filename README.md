# ThinkHealth

Record of my intern work at IISER-Kolkata for Summer 2024.

The aim of this project is to leverage LLMs to develop a symapthetic chatbot to aid patients in mental distress (such as depression).

It is deployed using Streamlit and can be found at: https://internthinkhealth1.streamlit.app/
